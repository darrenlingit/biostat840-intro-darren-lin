My name is Darren Lin. I'm a first year master's student in the biostatistics department at Johns Hopkins University. I was also an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins, where I majored in applied mathematics and public health.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring Baltimore and trying new things. I recently got into bouldering, which is really fun!
